### Background

I majored in Fashion Design and worked in the fashion industry in Korea  
for nearly 20 years â€” 9 years as a vendor designer and 11 years as a trend researcher. Each career shift showed me the importance of learning new skills.  
Now, I'm here to grow, explore, and expand my path.


### Hobbies

I enjoy gaming, especially Pikmin Bloom, which I've played since it launched 3years ago. Itâ€™s a walking game where I spread flowers as I explore the world. ðŸŒ¸ I also sew simple items like pajamas for my son and cushions, to keep my sewing skills fresh.
